# Implementation Plan: Deferred Shell Activation and Atomic Shell Reconciliation

**Branch**: `005-deferred-shell-activation` | **Date**: 2026-04-15 | **Spec**: `/Users/sipke/Projects/ValenceWorks/cshells/main/specs/005-deferred-shell-activation/spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/005-deferred-shell-activation/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Redesign shell activation around two separate truths per configured shell: the latest configured desired generation and the last committed applied runtime generation. The implementation should stop treating `ShellSettingsCache` plus `DefaultShellHost`'s current cache as a single mutable truth, introduce a refreshable runtime feature catalog that can be rebuilt safely during the app lifetime, and run startup/add/update/reload through a shell-agnostic reconciliation pipeline that builds candidate runtimes against the refreshed catalog before atomically committing them. Deferred or failed desired generations must preserve the last-known-good applied runtime when one exists, routing and endpoint registration must enumerate applied active runtimes only, and explicit `Default` behavior must remain strict: if `Default` is configured but unapplied, the runtime reports it as unavailable instead of silently substituting another shell.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: C# 14 on .NET 10 for implementation, multi-targeted source projects (`net8.0;net9.0;net10.0`), xUnit for tests, and Markdown planning artifacts  
**Primary Dependencies**: Existing runtime seams in `src/CShells/Hosting/DefaultShellHost.cs`, `src/CShells/Management/DefaultShellManager.cs`, `src/CShells/Configuration/ShellSettingsCache.cs`, `src/CShells/Features/FeatureDiscovery.cs`, `src/CShells.Abstractions/Features/IFeatureAssemblyProvider.cs`, `src/CShells.AspNetCore/Resolution/WebRoutingShellResolver.cs`, `src/CShells/Resolution/DefaultShellResolverStrategy.cs`, `src/CShells.AspNetCore/Notifications/ShellEndpointRegistrationHandler.cs`, and `src/CShells.AspNetCore/Routing/DynamicShellEndpointDataSource.cs`  
**Storage**: In-memory desired-state and applied-runtime records sourced from `IShellSettingsProvider`; no new external persistence is required for this feature  
**Testing**: xUnit unit tests in `tests/CShells.Tests/Unit/`, integration tests in `tests/CShells.Tests/Integration/`, and ASP.NET Core end-to-end verification in `tests/CShells.Tests.EndToEnd/` for routing and explicit default behavior  
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform .NET class libraries with ASP.NET Core runtime integration  
**Project Type**: Multi-project framework/library with abstractions, implementation packages, tests, docs, wiki, and sample app  
**Performance Goals**: Refresh the runtime feature catalog once per reconciliation operation, keep the current applied runtime serving until a successor candidate is fully ready, avoid tearing down unaffected shells during partial reconciliation, and keep routing/endpoints stable for already applied shells when newer desired generations defer or fail  
**Constraints**: Preserve strict required-feature semantics, fail duplicate feature IDs before mutating the applied catalog or applied runtimes, support partial startup, keep routing and lifecycle behavior applied-runtime-only, allow breaking changes where necessary, and place any new public operator/extensibility contracts in `*.Abstractions` projects  
**Scale/Scope**: Planning covers `src/CShells.Abstractions/`, `src/CShells/`, `src/CShells.AspNetCore/`, focused documentation updates, and new unit/integration/E2E coverage around reconciliation state, feature catalog refresh, atomic commit semantics, active-only routing, and explicit `Default` resolution

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Abstraction-First Architecture**: PASS. The redesign can keep catalog refresh and candidate-commit orchestration as internal framework seams in `CShells`, while any new operator-visible read model or runtime-state inspection API is planned for `CShells.Abstractions` before implementation.
- **Feature Modularity**: PASS. The work changes shell orchestration, catalog refresh, routing eligibility, and lifecycle semantics without weakening per-feature isolation, dependency ordering, or constructor constraints.
- **Modern C# Style**: PASS. The plan stays within the repository’s existing C# 14, file-scoped namespace, nullable, explicit-access, and xUnit conventions.
- **Explicit Error Handling**: PASS. Deferred missing-feature outcomes, failed candidate builds, duplicate feature ID refresh failures, and explicit `Default` unavailability will all be surfaced as first-class outcomes instead of silent mutation or fallback.
- **Test Coverage**: PASS. The feature requires new unit, integration, and likely E2E coverage for mixed shell states, catalog refresh failure, atomic runtime replacement, and active-only routing behavior.
- **Simplicity & Minimalism**: PASS. The chosen direction introduces the minimum architecture needed to separate desired from applied truth, reuses the existing manager/host/resolver/notification seams where practical, and avoids speculative optional-feature modeling.

**Post-Design Re-check**: PASS. The design artifacts keep the implementation centered on a small set of runtime-state records, a refreshable catalog snapshot, an atomic per-shell candidate commit flow, and one public status-inspection seam rather than a broad new abstraction graph.

**Structure Decision**: Keep the runtime orchestration work inside the existing `CShells` implementation projects instead of inventing a separate reconciliation package. The internal redesign centers on `DefaultShellHost`, `DefaultShellManager`, the in-memory shell settings/runtime caches, and a new refreshable catalog snapshot near feature discovery. The only planned new public surface is a minimal operator-facing desired-vs-applied state inspection contract in `CShells.Abstractions/Management`, plus any supporting public records or enums it returns. ASP.NET Core changes remain focused on routing and endpoint registration so only committed applied runtimes are visible to the web layer.

## Complexity Tracking
